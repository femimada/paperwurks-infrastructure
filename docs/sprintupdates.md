## Key Accomplishments This Sprint

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

- **Repository Structure:** Two-repo model implemented
  - `paperwurks-infrastructure`: Manages AWS resources via Terraform
  - `paperwurks-python-backend`: Manages application code and deployments
- **Modules Created:**
  - Networking (VPC, subnets, security groups, NAT gateways)
  - Compute (ECS, Fargate, ALB, task definitions)
  - Database (RDS PostgreSQL with automated backups)
  - ElastiCache (Redis for caching and Celery)
  - Storage (S3 buckets with encryption)
  - Monitoring (CloudWatch logs, metrics, alarms)
  - App Config (Secrets Manager, Parameter Store)

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions Workflows:**
  - âœ… Infrastructure deployment workflow (`manage.yaml`)
  - âœ… Application deployment workflow (`deploy.yml`)
  - âœ… Infrastructure testing workflow (`test-infra.yaml`)
- **Deployment Flow:**
  1. Push to `dev` branch triggers build
  2. Docker image built and pushed to ECR
  3. ECS task definition updated
  4. ECS service deploys new tasks
  5. Health checks verify deployment
  6. Old tasks gracefully drained

### 3. Configuration Management

- **Secrets Manager:** Stores sensitive credentials (Django secret key, database URL)
- **Parameter Store:** Stores non-sensitive config (debug flags, allowed hosts, CORS)
- **Fixed Issues:**
  - `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` parameter corrected from `"development"` to `"apps.config.settings.development"`
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS` updated to include VPC CIDR (`10.0.0.0/16`) and ALB DNS

### 4. Security & IAM

- **OIDC Trust:** GitHub Actions authenticates via OIDC (no long-lived credentials)
- **IAM Roles:**
  - `paperwurks-terraform-role`: Infrastructure management (infra repo)
  - `paperwurks-deploy-role`: Application deployments (backend repo)
- **Network Security:**
  - Private subnets for ECS tasks and databases
  - Security groups restrict traffic to known sources
  - RDS uses SSL/TLS connections

---

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. GitHub Actions Job Output Propagation Issue

**Problem:** ECS deployment failing with "Container.image should not be null or empty"

**Root Cause:** When using `environment:` context in GitHub Actions, job outputs weren't propagating between jobs due to environment protection rules.

**Solution:** Moved image tag generation to a separate `tag` job without environment context, allowing all downstream jobs to access the tags reliably.

**Result:** Deployments now succeed consistently with proper image tags.

### 2. Django Settings Module Configuration

**Problem:** Application failing to start with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'development'`

**Root Cause:** Terraform was setting `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` parameter to `"development"` instead of the full module path.

**Solution:** Updated `modules/app_config/main.tf` to use full module paths:

```hcl
"dev" = "apps.config.settings.development"
```

**Result:** Django now loads the correct settings module on startup.

### 3. ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration

**Problem:** Health checks failing with HTTP 400 "Invalid HTTP_HOST header"

**Root Cause:** ALB health checks originate from private IPs (e.g., `10.0.11.161`) which weren't in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.

**Solution:** Updated `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include:

- VPC CIDR range: `10.0.0.0/16`
- ALB DNS: `paperwurks-dev-alb-320469714.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com`
- Wildcards: `*.elb.amazonaws.com`

**Result:** Health checks now pass, targets show as healthy.

## Development Workflow Established

### Application Deployment Process

```bash
# 1. Developer makes code changes
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: Add new API endpoint"
git push origin dev

# 2. GitHub Actions automatically:
#    - Builds Docker image
#    - Pushes to ECR with tag: dev-{commit-sha}
#    - Updates ECS task definition
#    - Deploys to ECS cluster
#    - Waits for health checks to pass

# 3. Verify deployment
curl http://paperwurks-dev-alb-320469714.eu-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/api/health
```

### Infrastructure Updates Process

```bash
# In paperwurks-infrastructure repo
cd environments/dev
terraform plan   # Review changes
terraform apply  # Apply updates

# ECS automatically picks up config changes
# No need to destroy first unless changing VPC CIDR
```

### Local Development

```bash
# In paperwurks-python-backend repo
make dev         # Starts all services (backend, worker, postgres, redis)
make logs        # View logs
make test        # Run tests
make migrate     # Run migrations
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well âœ…

1. **Terraform Modules:** Reusable infrastructure modules made multi-environment deployment straightforward
2. **GitHub Actions:** OIDC integration eliminated the need for long-lived AWS credentials
3. **Two-Repo Model:** Clear separation between infrastructure and application code improved team workflow
4. **Docker Multi-Stage Builds:** Enabled building different targets (development, production, worker) from single Dockerfile

### What Could Be Improved ðŸ”„

1. **Testing Infrastructure Changes:** Need better way to test Terraform changes before applying to dev
2. **Documentation:** Could have documented as we built rather than retroactively
3. **Health Check Tuning:** Took several iterations to get ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration correct
4. **Monitoring Setup:** Should have been completed earlier in the sprint

### Action Items for Next Sprint

1. Implement `terraform plan` in PR reviews before merging infrastructure changes
2. Use terraform workspaces or dedicated test accounts for infrastructure validation
3. Create templates for common documentation patterns
4. Set up monitoring infrastructure in parallel with application infrastructure
