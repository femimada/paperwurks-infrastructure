# Paperwurks Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment Strategy

## Overview

The Paperwurks cloud environment is managed through a two-repository model:

| Repository           | Owner             | Purpose                                | IAM Role      |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `paperwurks/infra`   | DevOps Team       | Manages cloud infrastructure           | `infra-role`  |
| `paperwurks/backend` | Core Backend Team | Manages application code & deployments | `deploy-role` |

This split ensures a clean separation of concerns:

- **Infrastructure lifecycle** managed by DevOps
- **Application lifecycle** managed by developers

## Repository Responsibilities

### 1. paperwurks/infra Repository

**Purpose:**

- Owns all Terraform configurations for AWS
- Manages shared resources (IAM, ECR, S3, networking)
- Defines environment-specific infrastructure (dev, staging, prod)
- Enforces security and compliance policies

#### IAM Roles

**infra-role**

- Used by `paperwurks/infra` CI/CD pipeline
- **Permissions:** Create/update/destroy AWS infrastructure, manage Terraform state, manage IAM roles
- **âœ… Allowed:** IAM, ECS, RDS, S3, CloudFront, VPC, Secrets Manager, KMS
- **ðŸš« Restricted:** No ECR push/pull, no application deployments

**deploy-role**

- Used by `paperwurks/backend` CI/CD pipeline
- **Permissions:** Deploy container images to existing ECS services
- **âœ… Allowed:** ECR push/pull, ECS task definitions, CloudWatch Logs read, SSM read
- **ðŸš« Restricted:** No infrastructure provisioning, no Terraform access

### 2. paperwurks/backend Repository

**Purpose:**

- Contains application code and Docker configurations
- Builds and pushes container images to ECR
- Deploys to pre-provisioned ECS services

## Deployment Flow (Updated)

### Backend Deployments

1. Developer pushes code to branch (dev/release/main)
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggered in backend repo
3. Workflow assumes deploy-role via OIDC
4. Docker image built and pushed to ECR
5. ECS task definition updated with new image
6. ECS service deployment triggered
7. Workflow waits for deployment stability
8. Deployment complete

### Infrastructure Changes

1. DevOps updates Terraform in infra repo
2. PR opened and reviewed
3. PR merged triggers infrastructure deployment
4. Terraform applies changes
5. Infrastructure updated (VPC, RDS, ECS clusters, etc.)

**Key Principle:** Backend repo deploys applications, Infra repo manages platforms.

## Security & Access Model

| Role          | Trust Boundary         | Permissions Scope              | CI/CD Source         |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `infra-role`  | Organization â†’ DevOps  | Full infrastructure management | `paperwurks/infra`   |
| `deploy-role` | Organization â†’ Backend | Limited ECS + ECR              | `paperwurks/backend` |

**OIDC Trust Policy:**
Condition includes repository and branch restrictions for GitHub Actions.

## Terraform Integration

**Structure:**

- **Shared setup (`setup/`):** IAM roles, ECR, S3, KMS, networking
- **Environment modules (`envs/`):** ECS services, RDS, environment-specific resources

Shared resources created once, environment resources created per environment using `infra-role`.

## Role Interaction

Roles defined in shared setup and exported as outputs for consumption by CI/CD workflows and environment modules.

**Consumed by:**

- CI/CD workflows (via Terraform output or SSM Parameter Store)
- Environment modules that need role references
